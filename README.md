# CS 5167 (User Interface 1) 
### Project 1: Fitness Spectrum
 
```Level: Undergraduate```  

  
## Overview
This repository contains the code for the ```Project 1``` of  ```CS 5167``` ```User Interface 1``` course. The objective/goal of this project is to develop a ```Movement and Health Goal Tracking Web Application```, which I named **Fitness Spectrum**. This web application allows users to log and track their daily activities, customize goals, and visualize progress through a simple and intuitive user interface. The project is implemented using ```Svelte``` and focuses on front-end development with data managed through local storage.
